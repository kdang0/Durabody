                <h1>Why Durabody and our Poly Aluminum Hybrid Unit?</h1>

                <a1>In the industrial sector there have only been a few historic material options for a durable truck mounted service unit; steel and aluminum. Steel constructed Service Body units, while strong, are very heavy and prone to rust. These types of service bodies tend to last around 5 years before major wall and floor panel repair and replacement must be completed to ensure structural integrity and reliability. These repairs can be costly not only monetarily but timewise as well, putting your business at a disadvantage with competitors. Aluminum construction, which has been a long-standing alternative to steel, is a more expensive material, requires a higher level of labor and skill to manipulate, and is still susceptible to corrosion. These types or units can cost even more to service than their steel counterparts.

                    The Durabody Poly-Aluminum Hybrid Service Body is a radically new approach to conventional steel and aluminum truck body construction. Our goals in the creation of this design are to enable our customers to maximize their payload capacity and serviceable body lifetime with our cutting-edge polypropylene/aluminum hybrid service bodies. Our product line has been engineered to encapsulate the most desired features and solid performance our customers demand into a single proven product. The Durabody service unit is Constructed of ½ and 3/8 in polypropylene sheets that are reinforced with 6061-T6 aluminum tubing and stainless-steel fasteners. Our design is 60% lighter than the closest steel body and 40% lighter than a competing aluminum body! While Steel and Aluminum contend with the inevitability of oxidation and rust, our Polypropylene bodies are inert and will not rust. Service life on these bodies carry a limited warranty to 12 years. Our bodies are also engineered with remounting as a prime feature, meaning that once your chassis needs to be replaced you will be able to reuse your existing hybrid body onto another chassis, saving you time and money over the life of the unit.
                    
                    When it comes to selecting the service body for your professional needs, make the decision for the most cost-effective unit available. Choose the longest lasting, lightest, and most durable service body in the business. Choose Durabody.</a1>
